# little

Little is a very minimal text editor written in C. It has vim-style navigation keys, a status bar that shows your location in the file.

## How to use
Navigating is possible with arrow keys and Vim keys as well. 
PgUp and PgDn to move through a whole page.
Home and End to move to start and end of a line.
^Q to quit.

## Featured to be added
- Search function
- Syntax Highlighting
- Turn Little into an actual text editor
